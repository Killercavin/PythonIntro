import self_import
# This module imports itself, which is generally not recommended.

print("I will not be imported again, but I can still run code.")
# This is a self-importing module, which is not a common practice and can lead to confusion.
# It is better to avoid self-imports to maintain clarity and prevent potential issues.
# The code above demonstrates a self-import, which is not a recommended practice in Python.
# Instead, you should structure your code to avoid such imports.
# If you need to run code in the module, consider using a main guard:

# importing self module will make run again(twice) on a single run or call
