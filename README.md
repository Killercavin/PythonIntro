**DevHatch** is your all-in-one hackathon operating system — a collaborative, open-source platform designed for student teams to plan, build, and document their projects from ideation to demo day.

> 🧠 From idea to impact — DevHatch helps you hatch it.

> 💡 *Built during Global Hack Week 2025, inspired by the developer education movement led by MLH & GitHub Education.*

- 🔄 GitHub tracking  
- 📈 Progress timeline  
- 💡 Storytelling layer for Devpost & final pitch

## 🌍 Inspiration & Alignment

DevHatch was sparked during my participation in **Global Hack Week** by [Major League Hacking (MLH)](https://mlh.io/) in collaboration with **GitHub Education**, **Figma**, and **MongoDB**.

This experience revealed the true power of hackathons as a creative launchpad — and how students, when given the right tools, can build projects that rival startup-grade innovation.

We're building DevHatch to extend that spirit — a platform where student teams around the world can:

- Build faster  
- Collaborate better  
- Document and showcase their work  
- Create projects that live *beyond demo day*

We’re deeply inspired by the incredible ecosystems that support student innovation, including:

- **GitHub Education**  
- **Postman Student Programs**  
- **Google Developer Student Clubs**  
- **Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors**  
- **AWS Educate**  
- **Intel Innovation & Edge Hackathons**  
- **HP UN SDG Hackathons**  
- **MLH Fellowship & Local Hack Days**

> While DevHatch is not affiliated with these organizations, our mission complements theirs:  
> To empower the next generation of developers and builders through open tools, shared knowledge, and creative community.
