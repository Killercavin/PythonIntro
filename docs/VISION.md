## ğŸŒŸ DevHatch Vision

Hackathons are launchpads for ideas â€” but most teams struggle to stay organized, especially under time pressure.

**DevHatch** exists to:

- ğŸ“Œ Centralize hackathon collaboration
- ğŸ”„ Integrate essential tools (GitHub, Figma, MongoDB)
- ğŸ“š Encourage documentation and storytelling
- ğŸŒ± Inspire continuous iteration post-event

Whether you're building a demo, preparing for Devpost, or just trying to finish before the deadline â€” DevHatch has your back.
