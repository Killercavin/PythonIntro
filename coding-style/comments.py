In this topic, I learned what comments are and what they're used for. The main points are:

- Comments are used to explain what particular parts of your code are for.

- Comments start with a hash, #.

- Comments are ignored during the execution of the code.

- Comments might be above a piece of code, inline, or form a block.

There are specific comment formatting rules you should follow according to PEP 8:

- There should be one space after a hash mark.

- For inline comments, there should be two spaces between the end of the code and the hash mark.

- The comment length should be limited to 72 characters. You can split a long comment into several lines forming a block.

- Indent your comment to the same level as the statement it explains.
